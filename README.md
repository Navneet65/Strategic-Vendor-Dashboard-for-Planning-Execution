# Strategic Vendor Dashboard for Planning & Execution

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Strategic Vendor Dashboard** to analyze, track, and optimize vendor performance, enabling data-driven planning and execution.  
By combining **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, this project streamlines procurement decisions, monitors vendor KPIs, and helps organizations align procurement strategies with operational goals.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze vendor performance using historical data.
- Identify cost-saving opportunities and improve procurement efficiency.
- Build a Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring of vendor KPIs.
- Support data-driven decision-making for planning and execution.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design, KPI visualization, and reporting.



## 🔑 Key Features
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** Automated extraction and transformation of vendor data using SQL and Python.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visual KPIs for cost, delivery performance, and risk.
- **Insights for Planning:** Supports project milestone monitoring and procurement strategy alignment.
- **Scalable Design:** Can integrate new data sources and additional KPIs easily.
